# Project Context
In the e-commerce domain, providing effective customer support is crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. Customers frequently seek detailed information about products, which can include textual descriptions, visual images, and user-generated content such as reviews and questions. Traditional customer support systems often rely solely on text, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive answers, especially when queries involve visual elements.
A multimodal conversational AI system can bridge this gap by integrating both language and vision capabilities. Such a system can interpret and respond to customer queries that include both text and images, enhancing the user experience by providing accurate, context-aware responses. This approach is particularly valuable for e-commerce platforms, where users may upload images of products and ask about features, specifications, or compatibility. By leveraging multimodal data, the system can reduce response times, improve accuracy, and decrease the workload on human customer support agents.
